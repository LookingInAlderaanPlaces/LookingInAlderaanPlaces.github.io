                        Hello,
                    </h2>
                    <p class="aboutMe">
                        Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself 
                        and my passion for software engineering. I am a junior at the University of 
                        Minnesota, set to graduate in 2025 with a degree in Computer Science. From 
                        an early age, I was captivated by the world of technology, and it has been
                        a driving force behind my academic and professional pursuits. Originally 
                        from Arizona, I moved to the vibrant Twin Cities during my seventh-grade 
                        year. This transition not only broadened my horizons but also sparked my 
                        curiosity in exploring the intersection of technology and human 
                        experience. The diverse and fast-paced environment of the Twin Cities has
                        nurtured my growth as an aspiring software engineer. Beyond the 
                        classroom, you'll often find me engrossed in various activities that 
                        fuel my creativity and drive. I find solace in coding, where I can 
                        transform ideas into functional and elegant solutions. I immerse myself
                        in the latest programming languages and frameworks, constantly seeking 
                        opportunities to expand my skill set. When I'm not coding, you might
                        catch me indulging in my love for video games, which has not only 
                        provided endless hours of entertainment but also fostered my 
                        problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. As an avid 
                        snowboarder, I've learned to approach challenges with a fearless and
                        adaptable mindset, crucial traits that translate seamlessly into the 
                        world of software engineering. Additionally, I maintain an active 
                        lifestyle through running, which not only promotes my physical 
                        well-being but also enhances my discipline and perseverance. As I 
                        embark on my journey as a software engineer, I am excited to 
                        collaborate with like-minded professionals who are passionate 
                        about leveraging technology to shape the future. I possess a solid 
                        foundation in computer science and a relentless drive to continuously 
                        learn and adapt to emerging industry trends. If you're a recruiter 
                        seeking a dedicated and talented software engineer, I would be
                        honored to contribute my skills, creativity, and unwavering 
                        commitment to excellence to your organization. Thank you for 
                        visiting my webpage, and I look forward to the possibility of 
                        working together to drive innovation and solve complex problems 
                        in the realm of software engineering.
